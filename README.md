# Ode to ODEs

Welcome to ode_to_odes!

This is a supplement to the
"Dynamical Systems" chapter of my book
"Bayesuvius" at https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius

This repo provides Python
software that plots traces 
(waveforms) (i.e., $x(t)$ 
 for
state variable $x$ at time $t$) 
and Phase Portraits
for dynamical systems (i.e., systems
of 1st order ODEs 
(Ordinary Differential Equations)). The repo contains a
jupyter notebook for each of many
famous dynamical systems.
